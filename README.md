# ToDo-Web


A simple ToDo Web App to showcase my skills. 

## What it does

- Keep track of simple ToDo Lists (keeps it on LocalStorage).
- Mobile-friendly.
- Archive System (just to add a bit more complexity). Finished ToDos will be moved to the archive, where it will stay until the user removes it or the session is finished (archive is saved on SessionStorage).
- Sortable ToDo list and Archive.
- Keeps some meta data with ToDos and Archobe Entries (Creation date and finished date).
- Lighthouse 99 on Performance, Accessibility and SEO.
